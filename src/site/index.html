<p class="lead" id="comingsoon">gMachina is a first person, psychological horror adventure game, scheduled to be released on PC, Mac, and Linux.</p>

<p>In gMachina (Gee-mah-kee-nə), you play as a young woman who travels to a rural Washington town to escape a once complicated life, taking a job at the local hospital. Yet upon arrival, you learn a recent string of gruesome deaths has the entire town on edge, and wary of new faces.</p>

<p>Your life is thrown further into chaos as you find yourself at the center of a murder investigation and must act quickly to prove your innocence. But when it comes to a community shrouded in secrets, be careful who you trust. The relationships you cultivate (or destroy) may help you find the real killer, but could also lead to to your own demise.</p>

<h3>When is it out?</h3>
<p>Right now there is no official release date, but the goal is sometime in late 2016. The game will be released simultaneously on PC, Mac and Linux. There are no plans to release it onto consoles, but that could always change as we get further into development.</p>

<h3>Who is making it?</h3>
<p>gMachina is being developed by Unmodded, a small independent studio in Seattle, Washington. You can view the company website at <a href="https://unmodded.com/">unmodded.com</a>.</p>

<h3>What technology is being used?</h3>
<p>gMachina is being developed in <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/what-is-unreal-engine-4">Unreal Engine 4</a>, with some help from the addon community. gMachina is also being developed with the Oculus Rift headset in mind, and will fully support it at the time of release.</p>

<h3>How can I keep up with development?</h3>
<p>You can (and should) follow both gMachina (<a href="http://twitter.com/gmachinaGame">@gmachinaGame</a>) and Unmodded (<a href="http://twitter.com/unmodded">@unmodded</a>) on Twitter, but the best way to stay current and follow along with the development process is through the <a href="http://unmodded.com/blog/">official dev blog</a>, which is also mirrored on Medium (<a href="http://medium.com/gmachina-game/">medium.com/gmachina-game/</a>).</p>
